# Flask_lab
A demonstration of a Flask web application integrated with Bootstrap, developed for the Server-Side Web Development (CPSC4125) course, Assignment 2, Fall 2023.

## 🎯 Objective
This project was designed to reinforce knowledge of the Flask framework, Bootstrap integration, and API handling. The application fetches comic data from an API and displays it on the homepage, while the about page serves as a brief 'resume'.

## ✅ Requirements & Implementation
- __Flask Integration__: Utilized Flask to create a dynamic web application.
- __API Handling__: Integrated with an external API to fetch and display comic data, including the image, date, and title
- __Bootstrap Styling__: Incorporated Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design.
- __Templating__: Used Flask's templating feature to avoid code repetition for the navbar.
- __Routes__: The application features two main routes - root (home) displaying the comic data and 'about' showcasing some personal information.
- __Navbar__: Implemented using Bootstrap, linking to the home and about pages.
